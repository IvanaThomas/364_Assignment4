For this simulation, I chose to take the central registry route. 
The central register simply keeps track of connected peers.

The following methods were intended to meet the protocol:
send_offer: sends the offer message to all peers in the network
send_file: transfers file in chunks of 5120 bytes until EOF
send_ack: used in making sure that files transfer fully.

- To register (join) with the central server, the peer sends an 'r' packet and the server notes its' unique peer id with its' address. 
- To get the list of peers, the peer sends an 'l'

Both the peers and the central server use threading, to be able to handle multiple peers.
